## ‚ûï Arithmetic Operations in Python

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and then add integers
result = (3*4)+5
result
```

```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
```

These examples demonstrate basic arithmetic operations, which are foundational skills in programming and data manipulation.
